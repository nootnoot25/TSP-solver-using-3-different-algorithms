This project tested 3 different path finding algorithms in order to determine which algorithm would be most efficient at solving a given travelling salesman problem. The algorithms used were three different hybrids, for all 3
algorithms, 2-opt would first be used to narrow down the search space. After which one of simulated annealing, genetic algorithm or tabu search would be used.
